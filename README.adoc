== Objectives

* Centralize the information (= cartography) about "quickstarts/hands on lab" available to promote, educate our users around the   Microservices hype.
* Define the required vocabularity and maintain it to speak the Microservices language
* Cover & design the patterns required to develop a Microservices Architecture & Project
* Highlight the concepts inherant to a Microservices vision (Green & Brownfield)

* Describe the procedure(s) to follow to :
** Submit Project's information : Name, description, tags = categories, owner, link to the repo : github, bitbucket, ..., project where it has been designed/realized and /or implemented, objectives & requirements
** Request to "upload" Project's with also the cartography of the project
* Define the conventions to follow when a new Project should be designed in order to stay consistent all together, to reduce maintenance time/costs as ideally a POC should be reusable for a later version of product and could become a quickstart (The holy grail ;-))
* Stage incoming Projects for people not having a git, bitbucket repo till we find their final destination
* Describe the criteria that we will use to accept, refuse Project request
* Produce documents around the recommnended design/patterns & practices

== Convention to follow to create a project

=== Technology driven

Every git hub project to be created will be named according to this convention :

- The name of the project will start with a 3-4 letters prefix describing what type of content it is related to (e.g lab = Lab, Hand on lab; quick = quickstart, â€¦ ),
- Followed by the targeted container (e.g. swarm = WildFly Swarm; eap = JBoss EAP; fuse = JBoss Fuse; sb = SpringBoot) &
- Finally any keywords which will help to better define/describe what the project stands for (sec= security, sso = single sign on; tool = tooling).

Remark: The prefix, target & keywords will be separated by the underscore symbol.

So for the *Hands On Lab* project designed using *WildFly Swarm* as Java EE container and based on these technical concepts JBoss Forge as *tooling engine*, Keycloak as *SSO platform* to secure the application, we will name it as such *hol_swarm_tool-sso*.

=== User story based

A git hub project can also created by adopting a different convention where we favored the enterprise patterns, use case, domain, part of the project developed. In this case, we will adopt this convention :

- The name of the github repo will start with a 3-4 letters prefix describing what type of content it is related to (e.g lab = Lab, Hand on lab; quick = quickstart, demo = demo, ...),
- Next, we will include the shorter name of the main technology domain covered (e.g javaee = Java EE, integr = integration, brms = business rules management system, ws = web service, rest = restfull services, api = api management, mob = mobile, msg = messaging, cloud = OpenShift Cloud Platform, ...) 
- To continue with the keywords and/or elements which can best describe the use case covered

By example the *Quickstart* project designed to demonstrate how *OpenShift* and *Kubernetes* supports the Microservices *Service Discovery pattern* will be named as such *quick_cloud_servicediscovery-dns*
